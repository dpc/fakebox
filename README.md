## Fakebox - cross-compilation toolkit similar to great Scratchbox, but done simpler. 

This is a my personal backup repository for Fakebox. The original hosting
is still available at [asn.pl lab Fakebox page](http://labs.asn.pl/fakebox/)

Fakebox is one of many tools I worked on when working for [asn.pl] somewhere around 2005.
The original SVN history has been lost, but it has a sentimental value to me, and I still
think it was a neat idea (of the main author: Pawe≈Ç Foremski).

See `README` for the original README file.
